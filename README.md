# Returns

The Returns module by Virto Commerce gives you an opportunity to view and manage all return operations. Once a customer returns an item to your store, this information will appear on the Return screen, where you can view and sort the return list.

This module has a direct dependency on the Order and Customer modules, so make sure to have them installed before you proceed to installing the Return module.

## Functional requirements

As noted above, apart from the core Virto Commerce platform, you need to have the Customer and Order modules installed.
